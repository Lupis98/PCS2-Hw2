# PCS2-Hw2
This is the second project of 'principles of computer sience 2', at Sapienza, University of Rome.
The aim of this project was to compare two different functions of sorting a list, Quicksort and Mergesort, and in particular, after running them several times on the same lists, to see which one was faster than the other.
My function compares the speed of the two sorting functions mentioned before, by creating four lists of increasing order which are shuffled randomly; 
the function than runs respectively the Quicksort function and the Mergesort function on the same lists and time this process. By comparing the results of this several computations, which are also showed in the graph present in the function itself, and by dividing the two results of each computation of one function with the one of the other, we can observe that the Quicksort function is faster than the Mergesort function for each of the four examined random shuffled lists. 
The Quicksort function is, as we can see as a result of the experiment, almost 50% faster than the Mergesort function.
